# Waste_Image_Classification

Part of my Machine Learning course at Aarhus University, the goal was to build a CNN model from scratch and compare the performance of classifying images of waste with a pretrained model. In this case I decided to use a VGG-16 architecture for the from scratch model, and I used the MobileNetV2 model for the pretrained classification task.
